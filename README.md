## What is this?

A snake game. With a secret.

Each level hides a pattern you can't see while playing.
Finish the level, and it reveals itself — one dot at a time.

Four chapters. Four hidden messages.
A text field at the start that changes the ending.

> *Some things only make sense after you've walked every step.*

## How it was made

A product manager who can't code + AI pair programming.

- **Human**: product design, level planning, emotional arc, copywriting
- **AI**: code implementation, iteration, debugging
- **Tool**: Claude Opus × Windsurf

No traditional coding skills. Just a clear vision and a few late nights.
