# 💘 Valentine Snake
> Some words are hard to say, so I made them into a game

## This is more than just Snake

Four chapters, hiding four feelings:
- 💖 A heartbeat caught in the act
- 🌹 A flower, pretending it was random
- 💕 Words almost said
- 💍 A little promise

With every glowing dot you collect, you get closer to the truth
At the end, there's a letter waiting for you

## What makes it special

- Enter their name for a personalized experience
- Each level's pattern carries meaning
- There's a surprise at the finale

—— A love letter written in code, something like that
